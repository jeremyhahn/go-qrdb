# Release — Engineering

> **Status: NORMATIVE** · Scope: go-qrdb · Last verified: 2026-10-06

## Where it lives

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `Makefile` — `release-alpha` | the release recipe, run by hand: explicit version, lockstep audit, CHANGELOG reconciliation, standalone resolution of each nested module, duplicate-tag check, signed annotated tags, one atomic push, and a probe that asks the remote what it holds when a push reports failure |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | the Release workflow: `push: tags: ["v*"]` only, three jobs (`validate`, `gate`, `publish`), no bot secret of any kind |
| `scripts/check-tag-lockstep.sh`, `scripts/lockstep-modules.sh`, `lockstep-baseline` | the lockstep audit and the module-set derivation both the publisher and the auditor read |
| `scripts/check-version-reconciled.sh` | VERSION/CHANGELOG/tag reconciliation, run by `release-alpha`, by the Release Lockstep workflow, and by `validate` above |
| `.github/workflows/release-lockstep.yml` | the defence-in-depth audit on every tag push |

## Invariants

- **No workflow creates a tag or runs `make release-alpha`.** `test/buildgates`
  scans every workflow file, `release.yml` included, for a hand-written
  `git tag`/`git push --tags`/`refs/tags/` write or a `make release-alpha`
  invocation, and fails if it finds either anywhere.
- **`release.yml`'s only trigger is `push: tags: ["v*"]`.** Not the lockstep
  modules' own tags (`sdk/go/v*` does not match the glob `v*`), and nothing
  else — `test/buildgates` fails on an added trigger.
- **`release-alpha` never writes VERSION and never commits.** It tags `HEAD`
  and refuses, before anything is fetched or written, unless three things
  hold: `VERSION` on `HEAD` already names the requested release (otherwise:
  "VERSION on HEAD names X, not Y; merge the VERSION/CHANGELOG bump first"),
  `HEAD` carries an SSH signature, and `HEAD` is exactly what the remote's
  `main` holds. `VERSION=` is still a required argument, as the operator's
  statement of what they expect to publish; it is checked against the file
  and never replaces it.
- **Every tag is annotated, SSH-signed and on the release commit**, verified
  per tag before anything is pushed, and the whole set is audited for lockstep
  before the push. Any failure before the push removes every tag the run
  created.
- **The push is one `git push --atomic`** of exactly the release tags, never
  `--tags` and never a branch.
- **`validate` retries the lockstep audit.** The atomic push makes the server
  apply every tag together; it says nothing about how soon a `git fetch` on a
  different connection observes all of them, so the step fetches and
  re-audits up to ten times, three seconds apart, before failing.
- **`gate` runs the same commands as ci.yml's `lint`, `build` and `test`
  jobs** (`make fmt`, `make vet`, `make vet-tags`, `make secure-analyzer`,
  `make lint`, `go build ./...`, `make build-server`, `make coverage`,
  `make test-tags`) against the exact tagged tree, not a re-run of every
  ci.yml step — see architecture.md for why the rest is skipped.
- **`publish` needs both `validate` and `gate`**, and addresses the forge's
  own releases API through `${{ github.api_url }}` rather than a hardcoded
  host, so the same workflow file publishes correctly on Gitea and on
  GitHub. It authenticates with the run's own token
  (`${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}`, scoped by its job's own
  `permissions: contents: write`) — there is no separate bot identity.

## Credentials

**None.** The operator's existing git identity signs every tag, and the
Release workflow's `publish` job uses the run's own token, scoped by its
`permissions:` block. Nothing here needs a dedicated secret or variable.

## Tests

| Test | Proves |
|---|---|
| `scripts/check-release-alpha_test.sh` (`make test-release-alpha`) | the recipe against a local bare remote and a throwaway signing key, with the merged bump as the fixture's state: HEAD is tagged, no commit is made, every tag is signed and on HEAD, exactly the two tags are pushed, and three refusals -- a VERSION argument the file does not name, a bump the remote's `main` does not hold, and an unsigned HEAD. The first two fail on a recipe that still wrote VERSION itself |
| `scripts/check-tag-lockstep_test.sh` (`make test-tag-lockstep`) | the audit refuses a skewed set, including one whose deepest module's tag sits on another commit |
| `test/buildgates/release_workflow_test.go` | `release.yml`'s shape, with a mutation for each property: an added trigger, a widened tag pattern, a hand-written tag push, a call to `make release-alpha`, a lockstep audit with no retry or none at all, a skipped VERSION/CHANGELOG check, a `gate` job missing one of the matching ci.yml commands, `publish` losing its write permission or its dependency on `gate`, a hardcoded `github.com` instead of `github.api_url`, a reintroduced `RELEASE_BOT` reference, and a step that tolerates failure. It also scans every OTHER workflow file for the same tag-write and `release-alpha` violations |
| `test/buildgates/action_pins_test.go` | every `uses:` is pinned to a 40-hex commit |

## Test tooling this feature folder also owns

No `docs/testing/` folder exists, so the per-feature integration-test
tooling that spans every OTHER folder documents itself here, beside the
other whole-tree test/buildgates gates this file already tracks.

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `test/integration/features.mk` | the ONE table mapping every `docs/<feature>/` folder to the integration test files, relative to `test/integration/`, whose `Test` functions belong to it |
| `Makefile` — `integration-test-%` | the pattern rule, one target per feature (`make integration-test-<feature>`), that reads `features.mk`, extracts the mapped files' `Test` function names and runs exactly them over the self-spawned `sdk/go/testutil/qrdbdharness` suites — no Docker |
| `Makefile` — `test-pkg` | `make test-pkg PKG=./pkg/foo/...`: one package's unit tests under the same tags `make test` uses |
| `test/buildgates/feature_integration_coverage_test.go` (`make check-integration-feature-coverage`) | every `docs/*/architecture.md` folder has a `features.mk` entry, and every non-Docker integration `Test` function is named by some feature's file list |
| `test/integration/COVERAGE.md` | the per-feature, per-transport (REST/gRPC/QUIC/MCP/Unix/embedded) CLI coverage accounting, and every known gap |

`AGENTS.md`'s Testing section is where a lane reads "how do I test my feature
in isolation" first; this table is the engineering-level index of where that
tooling lives, kept beside this folder's other test/buildgates entries rather
than duplicated.

## Integration Target

Run `make integration-test-release` for this feature. The target intentionally selects zero Go integration tests because release is a tag/workflow process; the coverage accounting row is `test/integration/COVERAGE.md` under `release`.
